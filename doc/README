Best Debates Deployment/Admin Instructions

dev_root refers to the directory with the files README and TODO

You have two accounts on your server, knowlydge and staging.
I've given knowlydge superuser (sudo) privileges, staging doesn't have them

development

  to get the source svn co https://secure.odesk.com/svn/ronpaulreveres/trunk

  you can install all the required gems with  rake gems:install
  we use svn (subversion) for the code

  there is a development directory at /home/knowlydge/dev where one can
  develop if on the road or someplace it's not possible to use svn

Mark has been managing the repo

deploying
go to dev_root

  to staging: cap staging deploy
  to production: cap production deploy
  to migrate: cap production deploy:migrate

  cap(istrano) docs: http://www.capify.org/
  pretty good capistrano cheatsheet (pdf) at:
  http://www.scribd.com/doc/1618/a-great-capistrano-cheatsheet

  The deployment recipe deploy.rb details where things are on the server
  the file on the server which controls the mongrel cluster is not under
  source code control, nor is the mysql/rails config file.

    both files are in   /home/knowlydge/shared/config

server Admin

  webmin: http://bestdebates.com:10000 // user name admin

    webmin contains tools to admin all of the intimate details of the life
    of a linux server running Ubuntu, like yours

      Ubuntu docs: https://help.ubuntu.com/8.04/index.html
      Webmin docs: http://webmin.com/docs.html

  On the front page of webmin you get access to these stats, and a graphic
  of how your use of the sytem resources compares to what's available.
  If your server ever seems slow, this may show you why. As you'll see,
  today's' values are easily within the limits of the server:

    System Hostname   knowlydge
    Operating system     Ubuntu Linux 8.04.1
    Webmin version       1.441
    Time on system       Fri May 8 22:51:54 2009
    Kernel and CPU       Linux 2.6.24-19-xen on x86_64
    System uptime       142 days, 21 hours, 15 minutes
    CPU load averages 0.00 (1 min) 0.00 (5 mins) 0.00 (15 mins)
    Real memory         1 GB total, 725.67 MB used  <-- more free would be mo betta'

    Virtual memory     2 GB total, 19.80 MB used <-- not really great, should be '0'

    Local disk space     37.40 GB total, 20.80 GB used

  Part of what's been set up in webmin is the automatic backup of your databases,
  and here's where the backup files end up each day at just about midnight:

    $ ls /home/knowlydge/Backup

    2009-03-12_20h22.tgz  2009-04-01_00h00.tgz etc...


Best Debates admin: http://bestdebates.com, log in as admin

To ssh to your server

    from any terminal window (or on windows, from putTy)

    ssh -l knowlydge bestdebates.com

    the app deploys to /home/knowlydge/apps/debate/current and also, there
    are configuration files that aren't changed with each deploy at ../shared

  You have an nginx web server that answers normal web requests (port 80) and
  then distributes them to x mongrels running on ports y,z,l

  Nginx is easy to configure and faster than apache, though is one of a very few things that
  aren't controlled typically in webmin.

    nginx configuration is in /etc/nginx

    control nginx by ssh'ing to your server and

      /etc/init.d/nginx start
      /etc/init.d/nginx stop
      /etc/init.d/nginx restart

    nginx documentation: http://nginx.org (say 'engine-X', it's russian and fast)

    each time the config changes it needs to be restarted


If your server is slow, first thing to do is look at the webmin front page, then
to ssh in and type

    top <- which process(es) is taking all your resources
    next, contact slicehost

We don't have any monitoring on the site, but it's a good idea


The primary mysql user is named xxx
Mysql setup for the server is on webmin at xxx
